<p>Samuel Horsfield, Basil Fok, Yuhan Fu, Paul Turner, John Lees, Nicholas Croucher (2024).
<strong>Graph-based Nanopore Adaptive Sampling with GNASTy enables sensitive pneumococcal serotyping in complex samples</strong>
<em>bioRxiv</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.11.579857v1.abstract">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.11.579857v1.abstract</a></p>
<p>Nanopore adaptive sampling can reject DNA during sequencing by reversing the voltage
on sequencing pores. By making this decision dynamic and dependent on what has been
sequenced (in the current pore and the sample as a whole) unwanted sequences can be depleted.</p>
<p>We tested and optimised an application to serotyping <em>S. pneumoniae</em>. This is based on
a fairly long and structurally complex part of the chromosome, so PCR doesn&rsquo;t work,
but whole genome sequencing is usually overkill (or doesn&rsquo;t pick up minority variants).</p>
<p>We showed that this technique 1) works, 2) has various improvements over alternatives such as microarray
and physical methods (i.e. quellung or latex agglutination), 3) can be further improved by
using graph-based references of the capsule operon. We called our technique
GNASTy (Graph-based Nanopore Adaptive Sampling Typing, pronounced &rsquo;nasty&rsquo;).</p>
<p>We also showed that adaptive sampling is much less effective at enriching for closely
related samples, which has implications for its rollout in other applications of metagenomic sequencing.</p>

<h3 id="optimising-machine-learning-prediction-of-minimum-inhibitory-concentrations-in-klebsiella-pneumoniae">Optimising machine learning prediction of minimum inhibitory concentrations in <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em></h3>
<p>Gherard Batisti Biffignandi, Leonid Chindelevitch, Marta Corbella, Edward Feil, Davide Sassera and John Lees (2023).
<strong>Optimising machine learning prediction of minimum inhibitory concentrations in <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em></strong>
<em>bioRxiv</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.20.567835v1">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.20.567835v1</a></p>
<p>Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) are measured when collecting data
on resistance to antibiotics. These are a semi-quantitative measurement (ordinal)
giving the nearest doubling in drug concentration at which resistance appears.</p>
<p>In typical uses, clinical breakpoint guidelines are used to interpret these values
into a dichotomised resistant or sensitive classificaition. However, these breakpoints
can change over time and in some cases are propreitary. Furthermore, this classification
loses information.</p>
<p>In this work, we looked at the performance of three typical methods used in genotype-to-phenotype
prediction and inference in bacterial genomes: linear mixed models, elastic net regression and
random forests. We analysed their performance with different binning resolutions and censoring
of MIC data.</p>
<p>Using simulations and a real dataset of <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> we are able to provide
guidance for fitting these models, and collecting and reporting MIC data.</p>
<h3 id="accurate-and-fast-graph-based-pangenome-annotation-and-clustering-with-ggcaller">Accurate and fast graph-based pangenome annotation and clustering with ggCaller</h3>
<p>Samuel T. Horsfield, Nicholas J. Croucher and John A. Lees (2023). <strong>Accurate and fast graph-based pangenome annotation and clustering with ggCaller</strong>
<em>Genome Research</em> 33: 1622-1637</p>
<p><a href="https://genome.cshlp.org/content/33/9/1622">https://genome.cshlp.org/content/33/9/1622</a></p>
<p>Annotation of bacterial pangenomes is typically done one at a time. Each input assembly
is annotated by calling and scoring open-reading frames (ORFs), and aligning all of these against databases
to annotate function by homology. However, this is highly redundant. Many of these
sequences will be shared and therefore the same computational operations used repeatedly.
Furthermore, if genomes were annotated together population information could be used
to guide this process, with higher quality sequences guiding annotation in lower quality
samples, and overall more consistent gene calls.</p>
<p>ggCaller (graph-gene-caller) is a new approach which annotates ORFs within a population
de Bruijn graph. Building on key tools bifrost and panaroo, ggCaller combines the
steps of annotation and pangenome clustering, going from a set of input assemblies
to annotated GFFs and a pangenome matrix. We show this saves time (up to 50x faster),
and can give more accurate gene and cluster of orthologous genes (COG) calls, particularly in &lsquo;difficult&rsquo; regions. We
also show that this is a nice addition to the application and interpretation of bacterial GWAS.
Good results can be obtained for whole genomes, but also smaller complex regions
such as the capsule operon.</p>
<p>ggCaller packages a lot of the <a href="https://ggcaller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html">steps for analysis</a> of bacterial genomes into one place:</p>
<ul>
<li>Annotation of fasta files to GFFs.</li>
<li>Pangenome clustering and correction, typical plots (rarefaction, SFS).</li>
<li>Core and accessory genome alignment.</li>
<li>SNP calling in core and accessory genes.</li>
<li>Structural variant calling.</li>
<li>Sequence search.</li>
<li>Basic phylogenetics and visualisation.</li>

<p>John A Lees, Gerry Tonkin-Hill, Zhirong Yang and Jukka Corander (2022). <strong>Mandrake: visualizing microbial population structure by embedding millions of genomes into a low-dimensional representation</strong>. <em>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B</em> 377:20210237</p>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2021.0237">https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2021.0237</a></p>
<p>Dimension reduction methods are a popular way to work with large amounts of genetic data: PCA, t-SNE and UMAP have all been
used to analyse and visualise lots of samples in two-dimensions. These techniques are often used to cluster data, but have not been
explicitly designed to do so. Some of these methods also stuggle to work with the millions of genomes now available.</p>
<p>Here we re-implement and extend the stochastic cluster embedding (SCE) method to work with genetic data, which is optimised to
find visually identifiable clusters. Stochastic gradient descent is used to optimise, which we port to GPUs, and can run through
datasets with millions of samples in a couple of hours.</p>
<p>We show good clustering of all bacterial data in the ENA as of 2018 (661k samples) and SARS-CoV-2 as of Nov 2021 (about 1M samples).
We also make some fun videos and audio of the optimisation process.</p>

<p>Previous studies have suggested that piliated <em>S. pneumoniae</em> strains are more commonly carried by infants,
and there is a lot of evidence showing that infant immune response is different from adult immune response to carriage.
Vaccine modelling studies have also suggested that to more effectively immunise against pneumococcal disease,
the presently circulating population and distribution in adults and children should be accounted for.</p>
<p>We use genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to search for genetic factors associated with
<em>S. pneumoniae</em> carriage in infants versus adults, in a meta-analysis over two populations.
Overall we find wide between-cohort differences in strain composition, and between ages, but no
clear independent genetic signals associated with infants or adults. This supports proposals future vaccination strategies which are primarily targeted at dominant circulating serotypes in specific pathogen populations.</p>
