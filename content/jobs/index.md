## Master's and Internships

### Developing a comprehensive database and AI tool for accurate pneumoccocal serotyping from genomic data - now closed.

- **What**: In this paid internship, you will develop a database and AI tool for analysis of pneumoccal capsular biosynthetic loci, the target for Pneumoccocal Conjugate Vaccines (PCVs). You will also have the opportunity to deploy both of these on a web-based platform.
- **When**: This internship will run from February 2025, with a maximum length of 9 months, although this is flexible.
- **Who can apply**: Master's level students with an interest in bacterial genomics and bioinformatics. Experience in a programming language such as Python, Rust or C++ is desirable. UK and international students are eligable to apply.
- **Where**: EMBL European Bioinformatics Institute, located on the Wellcome Genome Campus in Cambridge, UK.
- **How to apply**: Applications closed on 30th November 2024.

## PhDs

For **PhDs**, application is through the [EMBL programme](https://www.embl.org/about/info/embl-international-phd-programme/overview/). We are likely to next have a vacancy in the 2026 round.

## Postdocs and Fellowships

For **postdocs** or **fellowships** send John an informal enquiry -- we'd love to talk to you and discuss your interests. There
are rolling fellowship opportunities that may be available depending on your career stage.

## Visiting Researchers
