We are the [Pathogen Informatics and Modelling](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/lees/) group
at EMBL-EBI (also known as the Lees Group). On this page you can find information about
current and past group members, who we work with, and some nice pictures.

## Lab members

**Hsueh-Chien (Raymond) Cheng** is a visiting PhD student (based at the Wellcome Sanger Institute)

{{< figure src="/images/group/raymond_cheng.jpg" >}}

I am a PhD student at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in [Prof. Stephen Bentley’s group](https://bentleygroup.sanger.ac.uk/#team) and also under the supervision of Dr. John Lees at the EBI. My current work is focusing on quantifying the invasiveness of *Streptococcus pneumoniae* with different genetic backgrounds by using the WGS data among populations. I am also interested in studying various modes of evolution in pathogenic bacteria and how they shape different population structures.

*Languages*: Python, R

**Joel Hellewell** is a postdoctoral fellow

{{< figure src="/images/group/joel_hellewell.jpeg" >}}

My background is in transmission modelling and statistics. I did my PhD at Imperial College London in the Malaria group with Tom Churcher and Azra Ghani. I then did a post-doc at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in Sebastian Funk's group. I contributed towards models that performed routine short-term forecasts of COVID-19 deaths, hospitalisations, and reported cases in the United Kingdom. I also worked on reproduction number estimates and modelling the sensitivity of PCR tests over the course of a COVID-19 infection.

I am now interested in integrating genetic and epidemiological models and data to see if this improves the answers to key questions that were repeatedly asking during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, how early can we tell that the number of infections is increasing? Does this novel variant have a transmission advantage? Does this novel variant cause infections with more serious outcomes?

*Languages and tools*: R, stan

**Samuel Horsfield** is a visiting PhD student (based at Imperial College London)

{{< figure src="/images/group/sam_horsfield_photo.jpg" >}}

My PhD focuses on pangenome evolution in pathogenic bacteria. I have designed and
developed [ggcaller](https://github.com/samhorsfield96/ggCaller), a new annotation tool
for bacterial pangenomes that works on genome graphs. Other projects include using
graph methods to improve adaptive sequencing of the accessory genome, and using
large population datasets to compare rates of core and accessory genome evolution.

*Languages and tools*: C++, python

*Organisms*: Bacteria (*S. pneumoniae*, *E. coli* and many more) and viruses (polio).

**John Lees** is a research group leader

{{< figure src="/images/group/john_lees_photo.jpg" >}}

My previous work has attempted to understand the pathogenesis and transmission
of infectious diseases. I primarily works on statistical genetics, genomic epidemiology and
genome evolution of pathogenic bacteria. I have also worked on infectious disease
modelling, GPU algorithms, and visualisation. I write methods and software to scale
these analyses and make them more accessible to others in attempts to democratise bioinformatics.

*Languages and tools*: C++, CUDA, python, R, stan

*Organisms*: Any microbe, but especially *Streptococcal* bacteria.

My personal website is www.johnlees.me and you can find [my papers here](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=UVV3P4UAAAAJ&hl=en).

**Leonie Lorenz** is a PhD student

{{< figure src="/images/group/leonie_lorenz.jpg" >}}

Leonie will be working on models of transmission and within-host evolution.

**Jacqueline Toussaint** is a PhD student

{{< figure src="/images/group/jacqueline_toussaint.jpg" >}}

While my PhD projects are still in the early stages, I'm broadly focused on creating bioinformatic tools for performing computational, statistical and biological analysis of bacterial genomic surveillance data. In particular, I'm interested in creating more efficient and accurate methods for performing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in bacteria, with the possibility of expanding to browser-based real-time analysis.

I've previously studied Biochemistry and Microbiology at Montana State University, with my Bachelor's thesis research focused on generating and analyzing multi-omics datasets. I’m excited to further my education in the lab of Dr. John Lees at EMBL-EBI and the University of Cambridge, UK.

*Languages and tools*: R, python
