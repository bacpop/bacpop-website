EMBL and UNESCO have recently announced a visitor programme as part of its infection biology scheme,
in which we are participating (along with many other EMBL groups, see the link at
the end for a full list).

Our group is participating in the scheme, and we'd be love to hear from interested candidates
who would like to work with us. We have particular expertise in analysing
genomic data from bacterial pathogens, developing and using new bioinformatic tools
to do so, as well as developing mathematical models for pathogen transmission and evolution.
We are a friendly and collaborative group who like to learn and work together, rather
than alone or in silos.

You can also see more details of our [research]({{< ref "/research" >}}) and our
[tools]({{< ref "/software" >}}).

If this is something that could be useful in your research plans and you'd be interested in either
a collaboration, or developing new or more skills in these areas please get in touch with John (_jlees at ebi dot ac dot uk_).

**Deadline 15th April 2023**

See full details of the scheme here:

> The current opportunity targets advanced PhD fellows, postdoctoral scholars, and tenure-track group leaders holding a primary affiliation with a research group based in Africa. Applications are especially welcomed from eligible candidates among the fellows of the UNESCO’s Organization for Women in Science for the Developing World (OWSD), and the L’Oreal-UNESCO For Women In Science (FWIS) awardees, who have demonstrated research excellence, and intend to use this placement opportunity to simultaneously expand their research program and contribute to capacity building in their home institution/region/country.

> The successful candidate(s) will be hosted by one or more group leaders within the Infection Biology Transversal Theme, spread across EMBL’s six sites in Europe – who will mentor and co-develop the project proposed by the candidate, in line with the group’s research focus. The candidate(s) will have the opportunity to benefit from EMBL’s state-of-the-art infrastructure and its vibrant scientific community and build an international scientific network beyond borders.

> EMBL will provide financial and logistic support to the successful candidates through the Scientific Visitor Programme Office, covering the costs for visa, travel and accommodation for the duration of their stay. Further funding may be made available on a case-by-case basis, taking into account information provided in the application form.
