# Introduction

Each year, between 5 and 10 French students can join EBI as interns through the embassy program. The embassy provides funding for these students to allow them to experience working in a research team abroad. This year, EBI had 8 French interns (even though we are only 6 in the picture). We all came from various parts of France, different schools, and were spread out throughout EBI between both the research and service teams. We had the chance to choose which team we wanted to join depending on the available spots. The two of us writing this article chose to have John Lees as our tutor for our internship.

The opportunity to participate in the French Embassy Internship Program in collaboration with EMBL-EBI was a dream come true—one that promised to challenge us, inspire us, and provide us with a unique perspective on the rapidly evolving field of computational biology.

My internship began with a group bonding activity where I had the opportunity to hear about everyone's projects, enjoy traditional English food, play bowling, and get to know my colleagues for the next four months. While starting an internship with a social event might seem unusual, it proved to be an excellent way to connect with the team and understand their work.

During my internship at EBI, I focused on developing user-friendly web interfaces for two tools designed by the team. These tools aim to make complex biological data analysis accessible to professionals without a strong computer science background. Given the importance of biological data for various fields, from public health to medicine, simplifying the analysis process is crucial.
My first project involved SKA, a tool utilising Split-Kmer Analysis using sequence reads files to efficiently align multiple sequences without full reconstruction. This technique enhances alignment performance and is particularly valuable for analysing sequence variation within pathogen populations, a critical aspect of public health and evolutionary genomics. The online platform I developed for SKA streamlines data input, analysis execution, and result visualisation for reference-based mapping and reference-free alignment, expanding its reach to a broader audience.

Subsequently, I worked on SBMLtoOdin, a tool created by Leonie Lorentz. EBI hosts a platform called Biomodels, containing thousands of biological models in SBML format. SBMLtoOdin converts these complex models into Odin, a language designed for ordinary differential equations, enabling researchers to explore model behaviour under different initial parameters. The online platform I built for SBMLtoOdin simplified model selection, visualisation of component evolution over time, and graph generation, promoting the reuse of research findings and fostering collaboration.

My experience at EBI provided valuable insights into my interests and career path. I thoroughly enjoyed my work and sincerely hope that the tools I developed will prove beneficial to professionals in various fields. I am deeply grateful to the entire team for their warm welcome and camaraderie. Thanks to them, I had the opportunity to play badminton, attend pathogen events at the university, explore new restaurants and cities, and create lasting memories. I extend my special thanks to John for his guidance throughout my internship and to Leonie for her patience in explaining her tool and working with me to make it more accessible.

# Conclusion

As our time with the PIM group draws to a close, we find ourselves reflecting on how much we’ve grown, not just as scientists but as individuals. We’ve gained a deeper appreciation for the complexity of pathogens and the power of bioinformatics in unravelling their secrets. More importantly, we’ve learned the value of teamwork, perseverance, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge.

We leave EMBL-EBI with a sense of accomplishment and gratitude. The skills we’ve acquired, the friendships we’ve forged, and the experiences we’ve shared will undoubtedly shape our future careers. The PIM group has shown us what it means to be at the forefront of scientific research, and we’re excited to carry that spirit with us as we continue our journey.

The PIM group, and EMBL-EBI as a whole, will always hold a special place in our hearts as the place where our scientific aspirations were nurtured and where we took significant steps towards becoming the bioinformaticians we aspire to be. Thank you for an incredible internship. We couldn’t have asked for a better place to learn, grow, and be inspired.
