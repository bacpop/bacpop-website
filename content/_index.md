==========================================

We are the [Pathogen Informatics and Modelling](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/lees/) group
at EMBL-EBI.

Whole genome sequencing has the potential to be used within timescales short enough to inform interventions against infectious diseases. However, current methods are struggling to handle the speed and scale at which sequence data is now being generated. This limits our analysis power, the responsiveness of inference to new data, and ultimately our ambitions for the purposes for which genomes can be used.

We aim to develop innovative, ethical and sharable approaches which help realise the power of sequencing to control pathogen threats. We are interested in both producing methods, and generating biological insights by applying these methods to data from a range of sources.
