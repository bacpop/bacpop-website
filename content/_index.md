# bacpop (*bac*terial *pop*ulation genomics & modelling)

We are the [Pathogen Informatics and Modelling](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/lees/) group
at EMBL-EBI (also known as the Lees Group).

We currently have two main lines of research: understanding the mechanisms of microbial evolution, and developing
methods and resources that lower the barrier to entry for infectious disease genomics and modelling.

We use the following methods to address these questions:
* Mathematical modelling of pangenome dynamics
* k-mer sketching and indexing
* Forward simulation of complex molecular and evolutionary processes
* Deep learning on gene, protein and DNA sequences
* GPU and multicore algorithms
* Lightweight algorithm development

For more information about these areas, see our [research]({{< ref "/research" >}}).

## Guides and blog posts

We publish sample workflows and recommendations for common population genomics workflows
in our [guides]({{< ref "/guides" >}}).

Other posts, such as paper summaries, reviews and short how-to guides
can be found on our [blog]({{< ref "/blog" >}}).
