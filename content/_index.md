# bacpop (*bac*terial *pop*ulation genomics & modelling)

We are the [Pathogen Informatics and Modelling](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/lees/) group
at EMBL-EBI.

We aim to develop innovative, ethical and sharable approaches which help realise the power of sequencing to control pathogen threats. We are interested in both producing methods, and generating biological insights by applying these methods to data from a range of sources.

Our current main areas of work are:
* Genomic epidemiology
* Statistical genetics
* Mathematical models of transmission
* Within-host diversity
* GPU and multicore algorithms
* Democratising bioinformatics

For more information about these areas, see our [research]({{< ref "/research" >}}).

## Find out more

To learn who we are and who we work with, see [about us]({{< ref "/group" >}}).

For more about our tools and methods, we have collated information on the [software]({{< ref "/software" >}}) page,
and you can also see our [code on github](https://github.com/bacpop).

We also have a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmp3iSn08C1wAQqC-S7evLw) where we post some of our talks.
## Guides and blog posts

We publish sample workflows and recommendations for common population genomics workflows
in our [guides]({{< ref "/guides" >}}).

Other posts, such as paper summaries, reviews and short how-to guides
can be found on our [blog]({{< ref "/blog" >}}).
