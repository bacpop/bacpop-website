# bacpop (*bac*terial *pop*ulation genomics & modelling)

We are the [Pathogen Informatics and Modelling](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/lees/) group
at EMBL-EBI (also known as the Lees Group).

We aim to develop innovative, ethical and sharable approaches which help realise the power of sequencing to control pathogen threats. We are interested in both producing methods, and generating biological insights by applying these methods to data from a range of sources. We currently have two main lines of research: understanding the mechanisms of pathogen evolution, and developing
methods and resources that lower the barrier to entry for infectious disease genomics and modelling.

We use the following methods to address these questions:
* Genomic epidemiology
* Statistical genetics
* Mathematical modelling
* Sequencing within-host diversity
* GPU and multicore algorithms
* Democratising bioinformatics

For more information about these areas, see our [research]({{< ref "/research" >}}).

To learn who we are and who we work with, see [about us]({{< ref "/group" >}}).
Current vacancies are listed under [working with us]({{< ref "/jobs" >}}).

For more about our tools and methods, we have collated information on the [software]({{< ref "/software" >}}) page,
and you can also see our [code on github](https://github.com/bacpop).

We also have a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmp3iSn08C1wAQqC-S7evLw) where we post some of our talks.

Databases and training course materials can be found under [resources]({{< ref "/resources" >}}).

## Guides and blog posts

We publish sample workflows and recommendations for common population genomics workflows
in our [guides]({{< ref "/guides" >}}).

Other posts, such as paper summaries, reviews and short how-to guides
can be found on our [blog]({{< ref "/blog" >}}).
